## 📝 Code Explanation
- `lyrics1` to `lyrics5` — Different sections of the song
- `display_lyricsX()` functions — Control animation speed
- `clear_screen()` — Clears terminal before starting
- Main block runs all lyric parts in sequence

---
## 🖥️ How It Works
The script uses:
- `time.sleep()` to control typing speed
- `os.system('cls'/'clear')` for clearing the terminal
- Separate functions to display each part of the song with unique animation timing

---

## ▶️ Run the Script
Make sure you have **Python installed**.

Run the program using:
```bash
python filename.py
```
(Replace `filename.py` with your actual file name.)

```
(Animated typing effect)
