# 🎤 Sahiba Karaoke Lyrics in Python

This project is a **Python-based karaoke-style lyric display**. It prints lyrics character-by-character with different speeds to create an animated typing effect.


## 📌 Features
- 🎶 Smooth typing animation for each line
- ⏳ Different speeds for different parts for emotional effect
- 🧹 Auto-clear screen before starting
- 📁 Organized lyrics in separate lists
- 🔚 Slow and expressive ending effect

---

## 🖥️ How It Works
The script uses:
- `time.sleep()` to control typing speed
- `os.system('cls'/'clear')` for clearing the terminal
- Separate functions to display each part of the song with unique animation timing

---

## ▶️ Run the Script
Make sure you have **Python installed**.

Run the program using:
```bash
python filename.py
```
(Replace `filename.py` with your actual file name.)
